# Employee Track
This app uses [Android Architecture Components](https://developer.android.com/topic/libraries/architecture/index.html).

It's a simple app that allows employers to enter the details of their
employees and show them in a list.

There are bugs though. This app was just to test myself on how long it
takes me to build a simple app. The bugs will be fixed and the UI
revamped just like I did to
[News Feed](https://github.com/CodeZilla7/News-Feed).

Contributions and suggestions on improvements will be great!

There are many dependencies that have been set up for learning purposes
and thus unused libraries can be removed if needed.
Contributions are greatly appreciated.
